# Capacity Perspective of Space-Time Block Codes

## Abstract

Next generation wireless system requires high capacity, reliability and data rate compared to 
the current communication system. To achieve such expectation space-time coding and MIMO 
systems are widely regarded as the most likely candidates for futuristic high data rate systems. 
Although, the Shannon capacity for MIMO channels has been known since few years, 
attainment of this capacity is challenging issue in many cases. On the other hand, Space-time 
(ST) coding has been proved effective in combating fading, and enhancing data rates [1,2] thus 
paving the way towards the attainment of the promised capacities.
In this project, firstly, we will study capacity of MIMO channel and it’s result as in [8] Then, 
we will examine Space-Time Block Codes from its capacity perspective [6] that is, at what 
conditions can we use space-time block codes in order to achieve optimal capacity. We also 
simulate the obtained capacity result to have better insight. Finally, we’ll try to extend our 
study to tensor space–time coding [17], which allows spreading and multiplexing the 
transmitted symbols into data streams.
